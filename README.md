SOS – A CRYPTOCURRENCY MADE TO HELP PEOPLE

Abstract
Nowadays, the world is suffering the pain of millions of people who live in poverty, have poor
living conditions, and can’t even fulfil their most basic needs. Every day we hear that more and
more people, including children, are dying of poverty, and all we do is hear the news and then go
on with our daily routine. We think: What can we do? We are so far away. How can we even help
those people? These questions have popped into my head too. And that is how I and my team
came up with the idea to create a coin, that is specifically made to help people. SOS is a
cryptocurrency that is made to help a particular category of people in need. This will be possible
with the help of many investors, who will invest in this coin. A percentage of every investment
will be added to the “charity wallet” which we have created for our project. Not only will investors
help in bettering some people’s lives, but they will also have a chance to increase their own
incomes.

Introduction
Poverty has been, is and is going to be present in our world as long as humans exist. We all know
what is going around the world with millions of people who suffer and are only trying to survive
another day. It is heart-breaking to see children calling for help, and mothers crying in despair
because they can’t provide the most basic need for their children: food. Every day there are people
dying because of hunger and thirst. It’s the fact that we don’t live near these people and we don’t
face their problems day after day, that makes us forget about them. We don’t see their reality every
day. We only hear about them once in a while on TV and then we switch the channel. We forget
that they literally exist and are part of our society. Even though we think it is impossible to help
them because we get so busy with our daily routine and our own problems, that we forget about
them, I finally thought of something beneficial for both parties.

This is how I came up with the idea of SOS Coin. SOS is a cryptocurrency made to help people.
Our main goal is to raise a fund big enough to help a certain group people that need financial help.
This is how it works: When an investor invests money on this coin, 20 % of the coin’s amount will
be automatically added to the “charity wallet”. And the more investors we have, the bigger the
fund is going to be.
But that is not all. While the investor is helping other people, he/she is also investing on their own
future. What do I mean by that? For every new investment by “new” investors, the “old” investor
will get four percent (4%) of the “new” investors coin’s amount. This means that the more
investors and the bigger their investments, the better for every investor. The value of the coin goes
up whenever there is a new investor.

And remember while investing money on your future, you are giving another child’s future a
chance too.
